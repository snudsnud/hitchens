***破境 [pò jìng] // beyond realms. (2023)*** <br /><br />

*Augmented reality synthesiser, physical synthesiser*<br /><br />

*破境* muses upon the spaces on either side of the boundary between the physical and digital realms, investigating the symbiosis that is formed by mutual language. Through performance, an improvised dialogue between an augmented-reality (AR) enabled instrument and a physical synthesiser emerges to explore the tensions and connections in mixed reality interactions. As computer controller lighting changes, both performers respond to the colour change to find harmony and foster sonic communication. <br /><br />

破境 is a continuing artistic collaboration between [Yichen Wang](https://yichenwangs.github.io) and Sandy Ma. <br /><br />

Debuted in 2023 at the Australasian Computer Music Conference 2023 & ElectroMUSE Concert Series.

***Dialogues in Space (A response to the big wide realm of nothingness in the sky) (2022)***<br /><br />

*PureData, Gibber, 802 Telephone, Micro:bit*<br /><br />

*Dialogues in Space* is an ode to the empty hollowness of space. Equipped with digital synthesisers, performers are able to communicate through the hollows of space.<br /><br />
